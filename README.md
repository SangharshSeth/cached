# Distributed Key-Value Store Project Issues

## 1. Setup Basic Key-Value Store

### Issue 1: Implement In-Memory Key-Value Store
- **Description**: Create a basic in-memory key-value store with operations: `Put`, `Get`, and `Delete`.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: The store should allow setting, retrieving, and deleting key-value pairs using a map.

### Issue 2: Add Unit Tests for Basic Operations
- **Description**: Write unit tests to validate the correctness of `Put`, `Get`, and `Delete` operations.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: All tests should pass and validate edge cases.

## 2. Implement Concurrency

### Issue 3: Introduce Concurrency with Goroutines
- **Description**: Modify the key-value store to support concurrent access using goroutines.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Ensure the store can handle multiple goroutines performing operations simultaneously.

### Issue 4: Add Mutex for Concurrency Control
- **Description**: Use `sync.Mutex` to protect shared data from concurrent access.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: The store should correctly handle simultaneous read and write operations without race conditions.

### Issue 5: Implement Read-Write Lock for Efficiency
- **Description**: Replace the mutex with `sync.RWMutex` to allow multiple concurrent reads.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Ensure that the store handles high read concurrency efficiently.

## 3. Implement Basic Partitioning

### Issue 6: Create Multiple Partitions (Nodes)
- **Description**: Simulate multiple nodes by dividing the data into partitions based on key hashing.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Each partition (node) should handle a subset of the keys.

### Issue 7: Implement Key Distribution Logic
- **Description**: Distribute keys among different partitions using a hash-based approach.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Keys should be evenly distributed across nodes based on their hash.

### Issue 8: Add Unit Tests for Partitioning
- **Description**: Write tests to verify that keys are correctly distributed across partitions.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: All tests should confirm correct key distribution.

## 4. Add Replication

### Issue 9: Implement Basic Replication Mechanism
- **Description**: Add replication of key-value pairs to secondary nodes asynchronously.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Each write operation on a primary node should be replicated to its secondary nodes.

### Issue 10: Ensure Consistency Across Replicas
- **Description**: Implement mechanisms to ensure consistency between primary and replica nodes.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Data should be consistently replicated without loss or duplication.

### Issue 11: Add Unit Tests for Replication
- **Description**: Write tests to ensure that replication works correctly and data is consistent.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Tests should verify that data is accurately replicated.

## 5. Handle Node Failures

### Issue 12: Simulate Node Failures
- **Description**: Implement logic to simulate node failures and test how the system handles them.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: The system should be able to continue functioning when a node is simulated as failed.

### Issue 13: Implement Failure Handling and Recovery
- **Description**: Add logic for handling node failures, such as retrying failed operations or redirecting requests.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: The system should handle failures gracefully and recover without significant disruption.

### Issue 14: Add Unit Tests for Failure Handling
- **Description**: Write tests to verify that the system handles node failures and recovers appropriately.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Tests should confirm that failure handling mechanisms work as intended.

## 6. Concurrency Testing and Performance Optimization

### Issue 15: Perform Concurrency Testing
- **Description**: Test the key-value store under heavy concurrent load to identify performance bottlenecks and race conditions.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Ensure the system performs well under high load and fixes any identified issues.

### Issue 16: Optimize Performance
- **Description**: Optimize the key-value store for performance, including improving efficiency of concurrency controls and replication.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: The store should exhibit improved performance metrics after optimizations.

### Issue 17: Write Documentation
- **Description**: Document the design, implementation, and usage of the key-value store.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Documentation should be clear and provide guidance on how to use and extend the system.
